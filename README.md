# Chat App Project

This project has been quite the journey. It started with the goal of learning **Tailwind**, which I accomplished. However, the focus later shifted to the **backend**, as it became the more complex aspect. The chat app is primarily backend-heavy, with some frontend components built in **React**.

I created my own **database structure**, and I hope I won’t regret it in the future. React presented challenges, and even small issues would sometimes keep me wondering for hours. But in the end, it’s been a great learning experience.

## Documentation

I kept detailed notes throughout the project, documenting every challenge and solution. Be warned, it’s quite lengthy:
