###Chat App Project###
This project began with the goal of learning Tailwind, which I successfully achieved. However, as development progressed, the focus shifted to the backend, as it presented more challenges. The chat app is predominantly backend-focused, with a frontend built on React.

Throughout the project, I designed my own database structure, and I hope it serves well in the future. React posed its challenges, with even minor issues sometimes taking hours to resolve. Despite these obstacles, I've gained a lot of valuable experience.

##Documentation##
I kept detailed notes throughout the project, documenting the difficulties and solutions I encountered. You can find the comprehensive documentation here: Project Documentation.
