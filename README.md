# Chat App Project

> NOTE: **This project was my first ever project with react, the design is humble and there are some bugs, this app took me 3 months, the code is spaghetti and it's mayhem in there, for your safety do not see the code; Anyway, i'm planning to build another one to see where my skills have brought me, I will try to write the next chat app, fast, using CI/CD (As in my portfolio), and most importantly clean code.**

> **You may have noticed that i do not usually use testing in my programs, that's because i see testing a waste of time, since i'm working alone, otherwise testing must be implemented if there is a group working on the project**

This project has been quite the journey. It started with the goal of learning **Tailwind**, which I accomplished. However, the focus later shifted to the **backend**, as it became the more complex aspect. The chat app is primarily backend-heavy, with some frontend components built in **React**.

I created my own **database structure**, and I hope I won’t regret it in the future. React presented challenges, and even small issues would sometimes keep me wondering for hours. But in the end, it’s been a great learning experience.

Features like blocking chats, deleting chats, messages, creating groups, editing messages, or video and audio calls weren't implemented because the purpose of this project was to learn tailwind, and those projects are create exercises for DELETE and PUT HTTP requests/database queries. Maybe in the future.

## Documentation

I kept detailed notes throughout the project, documenting every challenge and solution. Be warned, it’s quite lengthy:
