# Chat App Project

This project started with the goal of learning **Tailwind**, which I successfully achieved. However, as development progressed, the focus shifted to the **backend**, as it presented more challenges. The chat app is mainly backend-driven, which I used supabase for, with a **React-based frontend**.

Throughout the process, I created my own **database structure**, and I hope it serves well in the future. React brought its own set of challenges, with even minor issues sometimes taking hours to solve. Nonetheless, this project has been a great learning experience.

## Documentation

I maintained detailed notes throughout the project, documenting the challenges and solutions I encountered. You can view the comprehensive documentation here:
