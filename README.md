# Chatty (Abandoned)

This project is a modern Chat-App that has many features, including authorization, authentication, real-time, image/audio sharing, and more. 

### Why I built it

I loved the idea of having my own chat app, use it to talk with friends while knowing exactly how each message is reaching the other side. I actually built a simple chat app back in my junior years using PHP and Ajax, but it wasn't real-time; instead, it was polling every couple of seconds. I consider this my most comprehensive project as of july first 2025, and i would love to create more projects and application like this.

### How I built it

I started building this project with the purpose of learning React more comprehensively, purpose was achieved. I also learned:

- Tailwind
- SCSS
- Deploying
- Continuous integration
- Real-time interaction in apps
- Supabase
- TypeScript

### Issues

Although the chatting mechanism and real time is working correctly, there are a couple of issues, or bugs, that've been noticed while using the app. But, since the project has been abandoned, I didn't bother to fix it. 

## Requirements

To use the app, you need:

- A Google account

1- Clone it
```
git clone https://github.com/Mawhadmd/Chat-App-React

3- Add env variables

## Useful Resources

I wrote detailed notes throughout the project, basically my thought process. Itâ€™s quite lengthy:
